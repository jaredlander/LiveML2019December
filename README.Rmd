# R Class

This is an empty repo to initialize an R project for class at by `r organizer`.

Please __follow all instructions__ to set up your environment for the training.

# Install R and RStudio

This is just like installing any other program.

- [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

# Getting the Repo

In order to get the most out of class you have to be working in this project.

## `usethis` Package {#usethis}

Run these commands in the R console.

```r
# install usethis package
install.packages('usethis')

# get the repo
usethis::use_course('https://github.com/`r params$repoOwner`/`r params$repoName`/archive/master.zip')
```

Be sure to select the positive prompts such as `yes`, `yeah`, etc.

This will open the project in a new RStudio window.

You should have a new RStudio project called ``r params$repoName`` or ``r sprintf("%s-master", params$repoName)``. You can see this in the top right of RStudio (the name in the image may be different).

```{r proj-corner,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ProjectCorner.png')
```

# Install Packages

Setting up all of the needed packages^[Linux users might need to install `libxml2-dev` and `zlib1g-dev`] will be handled by running the following line of code in the R console.

```{r source-install,eval=FALSE}
source('prep/install_packages.r')
```

Answer `y` to any questions asked in the terminal.

If that fails, installing `{tidyverse}` and `{tidmodels}` with the following code will suffice to get started.

```{r install-tidyverse,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'tidymodels'))
```

# Getting Data

The data are stored in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jaredlander/coursedata) and can be downloaded automatically with the following line of code, assuming all of the packages installed successfully and you are using the RStudio project created earlier.

```{r download-data,eval=FALSE}
source('prep/download_data.r')
```

# All Done

That's everything. You should now do all of your work for this class in this project.
